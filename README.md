# Mykea Reviews and Drawers
#### Mykea: review and drawer components are a microservice in a larger recreation of the IKEA product page. The project utilized Service Oriented architecture and a reverse proxy server to combine these microservices into a cohesive and responsive web page.

# Walkthrough
### Drawers can be clicked to render detailed product information specific to the product selected from the search bar or suggested product compoents. 

### Opening the Reviews drawer reveals dynamic review data, including views of individual reviews and averaged review data at the top of the drawer. A pop-up modal allows users to write new reviews that persist after the application is reloaded. Individual reviews can also be rated for their helpfulness, which is also persistent data.
